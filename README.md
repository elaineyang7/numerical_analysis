A binary star is a star system consisting of two stars orbiting around their common center of mass ,their systems are very important in astrophysics because calculations of their orbits allow the masses of their component stars to be directly determined, which in turn allows other stellar parameters, such as radius and density, to be indirectly estimated.

Kepler-16b (formally Kepler-16 (AB)-b) is an extra-solar planet outside the Solar System. There are two stars star A and star B and a planet in the system.

Used the fourth-order Runge Kutta Method, there were three cases. The first case is that when the initial velocity is small, extra-solar planets hit star. The second case is that when initial velocity is between 0.5 and 1.0, extra-solar planets orbit is periodic. The third case is that when initial velocity is large, extra-solar planets orbit will migrate outward from this system.
